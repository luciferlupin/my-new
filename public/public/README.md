# Kaizer Website

A high-performance, modern website for Kaizer - Building the Future of Business, Trading & AI.

## Performance Optimizations

This website has been optimized for maximum performance with the following techniques:

- **Critical CSS Inlining**: Above-the-fold CSS is inlined to prevent render-blocking.
- **Lazy Loading**: Images and non-critical resources are loaded asynchronously.
- **Image Optimization**: All images are automatically converted to WebP format with optimal compression.
- **Font Optimization**: Web fonts are loaded with `font-display: swap` to prevent invisible text during loading.
- **Code Minification**: All CSS and JavaScript is minified for optimal file sizes.
- **Particle Animation Optimization**: Heavy animations are loaded only when they're about to come into view.
- **Resource Hints**: `preconnect`, `dns-prefetch`, and `preload` directives are used to optimize resource loading.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 14+ and npm
- Git

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd kaizer-website
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Build Commands

- **Build production assets**:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
  This will minify all CSS files and output them to the `css/minified` directory.

- **Optimize images**:
  ```bash
  npm run optimize-images
  ```
  This will optimize all images in the `images` directory and save them as WebP format in `images/optimized`.

## Deployment

For production deployment, make sure to:

1. Run the build process:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run optimize-images
   ```

2. Deploy the entire `public` directory to your web server.
